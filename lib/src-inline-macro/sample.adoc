:source-highlighter: highlightjs

This test file shows how the inline macro for source highlighting works:

Just wanted to say: src:python[print 'Hello world'] how you doing?!

That was highlighted because I wrote it like this: `pass:q[src:python[print 'Hello world'\]]`

Normal source macros should still work just fine... BTW if you're wondering how to invoke this, try src:bash[asciidoctor --trace -r ./lib/src-inline-macro.rb ./lib/src-inline-macro/sample.adoc].

And just because you can do inline syntax highlighting doesn't mean you should...
